    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I have decided to analyze and compare FBI background check data for gun purchases to Census data. I will review demographic trends in indviduals states, general trends over time for FBI background checks, and comparing the datasets to see if certain demographic characteristics are associated with higher or lower background checks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### High Level Overview of the Datasets\n",
    "**FBI Data** \n",
    "Data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NCIS) is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms. \n",
    "\n",
    "> When a person tries to buy a firearm, the seller, known as a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), contacts NICS electronically or by phone. The prospective buyer fills out the ATF form, and the FFL relays that information to the NICS. The NICS staff performs a background check on the buyer. That background check verifies the buyer does not have a criminal record or isn't otherwise ineligible to purchase or own a firearm. Since launching in 1998, more than 300 million checks have been done, leading to more than 1.5 million denials.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about NCIS firearm checks [here](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/nics). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Census Data**\n",
    "The data has been supplemented with state level data from the Census American Community Survey (ACS). ACS data generally contains population statistics such as demographic and socioeconomic data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The ACS helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses understand the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about Census ACS data [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes about the NCIS Data\n",
    "The original PDF of the NCIS firearm checks data contains important notes and caveats. It's a good idea to read those first before diving into the data. Among the caveats is this important one â€” emphasis added:\n",
    "\n",
    "> These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.\n",

Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",
